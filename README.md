# Logic Building Problems

Logic building is about creating clear, step-by-step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles. Itâ€™s the heart of coding, enabling programs to think, reason, and arrive at smart solutions just like we do.

Here are some tips for improving your programming logic:

**Understand the problem:** Read and understand the problem statement.  
**Generate Examples:** Create additional input and output cases for each problem.  
**Draw observations:** Draw observations and patterns based on the examples you created.  
**Start with Basic:** First, think of the basic way to solve the problem then optimize the solution.
