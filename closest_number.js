/* Find the number closest to n and divisible by m 

    Given two integers n and m (m != 0). Find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there is more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value.

    Examples: 

    Input: n = 13, m = 4
    Output: 12
    Explanation: 12 is the closest to 13, divisible by 4.

/* 
    Solution: [Naive Approach] Iterative Checking
    The basic idea is to start checking from n â€“ m to n + m one by one and tack the closest number.
